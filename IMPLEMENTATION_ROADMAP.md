# üó∫Ô∏è Implementation Roadmap - Automation Imperium

**Purpose:** Step-by-step plan to migrate from current ore-based game to full Automation Imperium.

## üéØ Overall Strategy

**Approach:** Incremental migration, not big-bang rewrite

1. ‚úÖ Build new systems alongside old
2. ‚úÖ Test each component in isolation
3. ‚úÖ Migrate UI gradually
4. ‚úÖ Keep game playable at all times
5. ‚úÖ Deprecate old system only when new is proven

**Timeline:** 10 weeks for full V1.0 release
